# L1: Union Find

## Quick Find (Original Union Find)

### Find (Quick Find): 
return root( node ). a.k.a. Find the root of a given node, O(1) time cause all connected nodes are assigned to the same root  in Union operation

### Union: O(N)
assign all connected nodes one identical root by looping through all nodes every time Union operation is called, and updating two to-be-connected groups of connected components with the new root

## Improvements

### Quick Union: O(N)
only point a to-be-joined node (or the root of the to-be-joined tree) to the root (node) of the other, instead of changing the root for all components in the trees (downside: Find operation becomes O(N), since we need to traverse from a node back to its root)

### Weighted Quick Union (Union by Size): O(log N)
point root of the smaller tree to the root of the larger tree. This way the resulting union tree will have more nodes at the top level than in the bottom -> more nodes will be closer to root, takes less time to find. More scalable.  (Find operation becomes O(log N), since depth of any node is at most log N (N = number of all nodes) ) we need an extra size[] array to keep track of the number of components in each tree (e.g. i = root(p), size[i] is the number of nodes in this tree.) Before merging, we check the number of nodes in each tree by comparing size[ root 1 ] & size[ root 2 ], and updating with size[ root of larger tree ] = size[ root 1 ] + size[ root 2 ] after merging. See screenshot below.

### Union by Rank (depth of tree): O(log N)
	UNION-BY-RANK (x, y) 
	r ← FIND (x). 
	s ← FIND (y). 
	IF (r = s) :
		RETURN. 
	ELSE IF rank(r) > rank(s) :
		parent(s) ← r. 
	ELSE IF rank(r) < rank(s) :
		parent(r) ← s. 
	ELSE :
		parent(r) ← s. 
		rank(s) ← rank(s) + 1. 

### Path compression:
when traversing nodes in Find/root() operation, point each node to its grandparent node, instead of its already connected parent node, to make the tree flatter

### Applications:
Detecting percolation
