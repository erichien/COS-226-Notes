since real world graphs are sparse, it is more ideal to use adjacency list than adjacency matrix

The path of the BFS on a directed graph is a directed tree which gives the shortest path from root to every vertex

it doesnt matter if we start at vertex 0 or 6 or 3, since 3 has no in degree, it will end up last in the post order stack (beimg last in the stack means it is the first thing we need to complete, the ultimate dependency)

## Detect Cycles in Directed Graph

Depth First Traversal can be used to detect cycle in a Graph. DFS for a connected graph produces a tree. There is a cycle in a graph only if there is a back edge present in the graph. A back edge is an edge that is from a node to itself (selfloop) or one of its ancestor in the tree produced by DFS.

To detect a back edge, we can keep track of vertices currently in recursion stack of function for DFS traversal. If we reach a vertex that is already in the recursion stack, then there is a cycle in the tree. The edge that connects current vertex to the vertex in the recursion stack is back edge.

## Strongly Connected Components

some vertices are strongly connected, others are not.

If there is cycle among some vertices, they are strongly connected.

From a vertex we cannot walk backwards in topological order. Since components are in topological order, doing DFS starting from any vertex within a strongly connected component will end within the strongly connected component, and not being able to go backwards in topological order, to another strongly connected component. Therefore, we are able to separate strongly connected components when working backwards of topological order, therefore finding out which vertices are strongly connected.

Topological sort operations can still be carried out then there are cycles in the graph, only the result would not be accurate (a.k.a there will be mutual dependencies since there are cycles in the graph, therefore wont exactly have a "topological order"). (To detect cycles, we need to keep a set of visited vertices during each DFS.) Therefore, we can still get the "Topological postorder stack" after doing topological sort on a cyclic graph, and it can help us find strongly connected components.
