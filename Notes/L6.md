# L6 Quicksort

## Quicksort

### Time complexity: O( N lg N )

Since the expected number of compares on average is ~1.39 N lg N 

Quicksort has 39% more compares than mergesort, but it's faster than mergesort in practice because of less data movement (operations), quicksort simply moves pointer forward.

Quicksort is not stable, but shuffling the input array guarantees better performance.

### Space complexity

Quicksort is an in-place sorting algorithm. 

Partitioning: Constant extra space, a.k.a no extra space

Depth of recursion: logarithmic extra space (can be approximated with random shuffling input)

## Quick select (select Kth largest)

Min (k = 0), max (k = N-1)

If k was small (e.g. 1st, 2nd, 3rd smallest) or large (e.g. N-1, N-2 smallest, = 1st, 2nd largest)

=> Time complexity ~Ø(n), since we only have to loop over once, keep track of top few num

Otherwise, we can always get O( N log N ) time complexity with sorting.

With Quick Select, we can get O(N) linear time on average

### Time complexity: O(N) on average

Time complexity: N + N/2 + N/4 + … + 1 ~ 2N => O(N) on average

~ 1/2 N^2 compares in the worst case

Use quick select if a full-sort isn't needed!

despite being linear time complexity, the operations of quick select still make the constants too high => not used in practice. A practical linear-time worst case algorithm still needs to be discoverd.

## Improvements

### Insertion sort on small subarrays

### Choose median as pivot item

### Best case analysis

paritition step divide every subarray exactly in half => ~ N lg N compares

### Worst case analysis

input array already sorted/reverse sorted. Since we always pick the left most item as the Pivot item, during partition after we scan through the arraying, since everything is sorted, no elements are swaped, only the pivot item is eliminated everytime. Therefore we are scanning the N +N-1 + N-2 + … 1 number of items in total 

=> ~ 1/2 N^2 compares, and thats why we need to shuffle input array

### Duplicate Keys: 3-way Quicksort w/ Dijkstra 3-way partitioning

When duplicates are present, it is (counter-intuitively) better to stop scans on keys equal to the partitioning item’s key. Time goes quadratic O(N^2) if the algorithm doesn't stop partitioning when on equal keys. 

Quicksort with 3-way partitioning reduces running time from linearithmic O(N lg N) to linear O(N) in broad class of applications.

### In Practice: Bentley-Mcilroy 3-way partitioning

Tukey's ninther does better partitioning than random shuffle, and is less costly.

But since it doesn't do the random shuffle, it can overflow function call stack and crash in rare circumstances 

=> not completely solid, shuffling is needed

### In Practice: Dual-pivot quicksort

Now widely used. Java 8, Python unstable sort, Android, …

## Q: Why use different algorithms for primitive and reference types? 

### Dual-pivot quicksort is used for primitive types, Timsort (mergesort + insertion sort) for reference types (objects)

A: Implementors of Java believe that, for programmers using objects, space may not be critically important, therefore the extra space used by mergesort is probably not a problem. For programmers using the primitive types, performance (quicksort) might be the most important thing.
