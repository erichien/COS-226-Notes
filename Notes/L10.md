# L10 Hash Tables 


Hash function

Hash table

Linear probing: 

when put() we might have to wrap around the array (loop back) to the 0th index if empty cells are not found, therefore when incrementing index, we use i = (i + 1) % m, same for get()
When get() key aren’t found until encountering an empty cell, it means the key doesn’t exist in the array / table, Therefore, Deletion in hash table while using linear probing requires extra care

Separate chaining vs. linear probing 

Separate chaining. 
・Performance degrades gracefully. 
・Clustering less sensitive to poorly-designed hash function. 

Linear probing. 
・Less wasted space. 
・Better cache performance.
